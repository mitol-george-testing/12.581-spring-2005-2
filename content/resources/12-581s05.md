description: The Clapeyron slopes of mantle phase boundaries and mantle convection.
  Near a phase boundary with positive Clapeyron slope (top), materials in cold region
  transform to high-pressure phase (denser) at shallower depth than those in hot region.
  Instead, near a phase boundary with negative Clapeyron slope (Bottom), materials
  in hot region transform to high-pressure phase (denser) at shallower depth than
  those in cold region. Therefore, phase boundary together with temperature difference
  results in density anomaly near phase boundary. (Image by Prof. Sang-heon Shim.)
